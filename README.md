# Pierre's Vendors

### A Week IX Epicodus Project, 14 May 2021

_By Jonathan Stull_

## **Description**

Pierre's Vendors is a web application that helps Pierre of [Pierre's Patisserie](https://github.com/jonathanstull/pierres-patisserie.git) store and track his vendors and orders. With this web application, Pierre has a way to build his vendor database with vendor information and an order history. He can add new vendors and orders and view the vendors and orders that he has added.
